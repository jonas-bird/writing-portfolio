# Indoor wood shutters: brighten up your living spaces

Estate Millwork is best known for our exterior wood shutters. But did you know that we create beautiful indoor wood shutters on spec, too?  

History shows that indoor wood shutters are a popular home decorating choice. During this great nation’s earliest days, pioneers installed rudimentary indoor wood shutters to keep out pests. Back then, pests were a big deal – mosquitos transmitted malaria, and robbers could devastate a family’s homestead. Indoor wood shutters also functioned as climate-control devices. They kept out the scorching noon sun, and they protected the homestead against the evening’s chill.   

Today, indoor wood shutters offer lovely, decorative accents. That’s not all – they also offer privacy, insulation, and sound dampening. And, they can be custom-ordered to flatter any room or any interior décor in your home.   

## Such a selection! Estate Millwork indoor wood shutters offer variety

If you want to achieve a luxurious, dramatic effect, install floor-to-ceiling panel shutters. We like louvered and plantation styles best, but all of our traditional shutter styles can be converted into indoor wood shutters.  

Floor-to-ceiling indoor wood shutters are designed to cover tall windows. They can be customized to look like folding screens, doorways, closets, or pretty sculptures. Opt for customized faux lift rods or customized rails and stiles for an extra-elegant touch.  

Perhaps full shutters are too much for you – or you don’t have tall windows. Half-size indoor wood shutters make bathrooms homier, bedrooms more chic, and turn living rooms into conversation pieces.  

If you crave privacy, consider installing indoor wood shutters with operable louvers. This popular shutter style allows you to control the angle of the louvers, so you decide whether you want to say hello to the world or stay tucked away. When the sun is setting in the summer, open the louvers halfway and allow the dusk to peep through and flood your interiors with a warm red glow.   

Choose shutters with narrow operable lovers for a more traditional look. Or, pick our plantation indoor wood shutters for a touch of contemporary chic. The wider louvers lend a modern feel to any interior – and look great in lofts and colonial homes alike.  

## Indoor wood shutters: fully customizable
Estate Millwork offers our customers a wide array of options for customizing indoor wood shutters. We offer nine cuts of top-grade hardwood: red oak, white oak, cherry, maple, walnut, teak, cedar, poplar, mahogany.  

Because we recognize that indoor wood shutters are aesthetic as well as functional, we’ve created a special collection especially for interiors. The Cottage Collection is a hybrid line that combines louvered and paneled shutter styles and is exquisite in a variety of interior settings. Of course, our panel and louvered shutters can be transformed into indoor wood shutters, too.  

Customize your shutters further – opt for custom mouldings, detail-rich inlay designs, radius work (ideal for semicircular windows), beading, or mouse holes. Finish your shutters with bright paints or rich stains to complement your interior decorating schemes. All Estate Millwork indoor wood shutters are made to order, so the choice is yours.
