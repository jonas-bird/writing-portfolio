# Estate Millwork unfinished wood shutters: endless options

Genuine wood shutters lend charm and beauty to your home that cannot be beat. Estate Millwork recognizes that every home is different – and every homeowner has unique tastes. That’s why we sell unfinished wood shutters in a variety of sizes and styles. You can paint, stain, or carve your unfinished wood shutters to your delight.  

## Unfinished wood shutters: natural wood is beautiful

Each pair of Estate Millwork unfinished wood shutters is crafted from genuine, top-grade hardwoods. All of our wood comes from sustainable harvest timber companies – so if you’re a green architect or home builder, we’re a great choice.  

The natural beauty of unfinished hardwood is breathtaking on your home. Order your unfinished wood shutters in natural cherry, maple, walnut, teak, oak, poplar, walnut, or mahogany wood. If you appreciate the natural beauty of unblemished pure hardwood like we do, simply apply a coat of weather-resistant clear lacquer. Your shutters will look handsome for years – for decades and decades with proper maintenance.  

Order your unfinished wood shutters in a variety of pleasing wood cuts. We offer quarter-sawn, crotch-grain, and book-matching wood cuts. The definitions of these styles are as follows:  

-Quarter-sawn shutters are created from timber logs that are quartered and cut against the tree’s natural grain pattern, resulting in a beautiful, wavy wood grain.  

-Crotch-grain shutters are created from lumber from the forked parts of trees. Your unfinished wood shutters will have marble-like wood-grain patterns.  

-Book-matched shutters have mirror-image wood-grain patters. This is because the timber is sawn straight down the center, resulting in symmetrical twin pieces.  

## Customize your unfinished wood shutters further

At Estate Millwork, we work hard to produce the results you want. That’s why we’re proud to offer a huge array of customization options for your unfinished wood shutters. Custom beveling, radius work, inlays, or applied mouldings all look stunning in natural, unfinished wood. Or, opt for shutters with operative louvers, decorative dowel rods, or ornate custom stiles and rails.  

## All the colors of the rainbow – and the stains, too – complement your unfinished wood shutters

Your unfinished wood shutters will arrive with absolutely no finish, varnish, or stain on them. They’re ready for your special custom touch. You can paint our shutters to match your home. Choose big, bold colors for a daring contrast, or subdued tones for a mature look.  

Clear or colored stains enhance the beauty and richness of natural wood. You can select a stain that’s the same hue as the wood used to make your unfinished shutters, or you can choose a contrasting stain to bring out other tones in the wood.  

## Durable and energy efficient: more reasons to choose Estate Millwork unfinished wood shutters

Each pair of Estate Millwork unfinished wood shutters is created from real hardwood. There are no fillers or plastic compounds in our shutters – so they form a tight, energy efficient seal.  

All of our shutters are assembled using real mortise-and-tenon joinery. This assembly method is the strongest on the market today, and results in a sturdy, seamless shutter that lasts for generations.
